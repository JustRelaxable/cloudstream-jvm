# Cloudstream JVM

This repository contains code for base cloudstream functionality without android dependencies. It includes 2 projects: Core and Webserver. 

Use Core for plugin management, repository management, file IO. Its code taken from original CS android app. It needs a lot of improvements so PRs are welcome.

Use Webserver for exposing Core functionality as well as proxy. Build your app on top of it. Again PRs are welcome.
